 * math/math.c:
    Added sin, cos and tan functions (and there inverse, hyperbolic and invers hyperbolic versions).

10-11-'11 Steven van der Schoot:
 * mm/memory:
    Fixed the memcpy function. When copying data to a higher addres with an overlap (e.g. from addres 10 to 20 with size 30). The data will be correctly moved to the new addres. (This makes the data from the original addres incorrect!).

 * mm/map.c:
    This file holds the new memory map, which is responsible for keeping track
    of which pages have been allocated, and which are free.
    In the future we will connect our swapping deamon with this map, to keep
    enough pages free.

 * mm/paging.c:
    We have implemented a new paging subsystem which only allocs a page-table
    when it is required, keeping memory usage to a relative minimum.
    What still needs to be done is keep better track of the location of the page
    directory which is now approached with a fixed offset.

 * kern/sched.c
    Stubs are made for multiple threads. This enables us to keep track of
    segments for individual processes. these segments are implemented as doubly-
    linked lists in the memory map in mm/map.c.
