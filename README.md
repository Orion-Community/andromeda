* gcc
* g++
* ld
* nasm

* wget
* A working network installation
* A working linux installation
The code has been compiled once on windows, though no instructions on how to do
this have been made available.

* qemu

Contributing
------------

This kernel is free software and we welcome contributions of any form. Below is
a list of possible things you could help with, or you could just scratch your
own itch, that's just fine.

There's a number of ways to get your changes into the kernel code. One of those
is to send us a pull-request, and then send this to us in the google group/
mailing list. Of course you can also format patches and send those in to the
same group.

Github pull requests might work for some projects, but in order to keep the
development in a central place, the preference goes out to patches and pull
requests in the google group mailing list.
